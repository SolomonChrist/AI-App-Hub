# Solomon Christ AI Hub ðŸš€

## Vision
A single page that lists all AI apps and projects from Solomon Christ's GitHub profile automatically. It's designed to be a central, always-up-to-date hub for exploring projects and their live demos.

## Features
- **Automatic Repo Fetching**: Pulls the latest public repositories directly from the GitHub API.
- **Responsive Grid**: Displays projects in a clean, modern, and responsive card-based grid.
- **Quick Links**: Each project card includes direct links to its GitHub repository and, if available, a live demo on GitHub Pages.
- **Live Search**: Instantly filter projects by name using the search bar.
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Built as a frontend-only application for maximum performance.
